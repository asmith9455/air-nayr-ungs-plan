
# Short-term Objective

I intend to use this repository as a tool to plan and verify the nutritional content of my diet.

# Long-term Objective

I would like to extend it the tool to include schedules for shopping/cooking, in addition to making the information accessible in a more presentable format (perhaps a nice Angular-based webpage).

# What's with the name?

*air-nayr-ungs-plan* is intended to sound like the word "Ern√§hrungsplan" in German (which means nutrition plan), when pronounced by an English-speaker.

# From where does the nutrition information originate?

I intend to use https://github.com/jithesh82/noms, which was forked from https://github.com/noahtren/noms, which reads data from a nutritional database compiled by the USDA. To make it easy to work with noms (which I currently belive requires maintenance), I've included it in this project as a git submodule.
